this is a django project you can host on your own computer! 

set "arg" equal to your API key for CTFd. You can create an API key in the "Access Tokens" sections of your CTFd account. Please note, if you happen to see an API key somewhere in the git history, I have long since deleted it and you are not an OSINT wizard. Nice try.

to host locally, run "manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:5000" in the root of the application. browse to the address (you can change the port if you want). profit!
